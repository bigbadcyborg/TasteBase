# TasteBase
> *The go-to place to pick out your meals. Just pick an ingredient (or more) and let us find you recipes!*

Aaron Espinoza, Heston Montagne, Dylan Priebe, Jeremiah Stone, and Russell Sullivan are working together to create a web-app that connects users who want to improve their cooking skills to recipes that are relevant to their tastes and available ingredients. The goal of the app is to make cooking feel easier for aspiring cooks who find the process daunting by simplifying the research step.

## General Information
TasteBase is the solution to figuring out what you want to cook. We intend to make recipe selection the easiest process in the world, based on the ingredients you have at home already.
We hope to help everyone who cooks pick out their food more easily and deliberately.

# Features

### Pantry Tracking
This feature allows users to add and remove ingredients from their personal pantry so they can easily track their available ingredients. 

***Corresponding Stories***

- As a general user, I want to view a list of my ingredients so that I can easily track my available ingredients for cooking. 

- As a general user, I want to add ingredients to my pantry so that I can keep my pantry up to date when I buy new food items. 

- As a general user, I want to delete ingredients from my pantry so that I can keep my pantry up to date as I use or get rid of food items.


### Recipe Suggestion
This feature allows the app to suggest recipes to the user for them to cook. It uses the user's pantry to filter recipes based on ingredients the user has on hand. 

***Corresponding Stories***

- As a general user, I want the app to recommend recipes for me to cook so I can try out new recipes when cooking.

- As a general user, I want the recipes recommended to me to be filtered to fit the ingredients I have in my pantry. 

### Recipe Saving
Users can save existing recipes from the app's suggestion list or search results for quick access later.

***Corresponding Stories***

- As a general user, I want to save a recipe from the suggestions so that I can easily find it again.

- As a general user, I want to view my saved recipe list so that I can quickly pick from my personal favorites.

- As a general user, I want to remove a saved recipe so that I can keep my list relevant.

### Recipe Creating
This feature gives the user the ability to list the required ingredients necessary for their own recipes to be suggested later.

***Corresponding Stories***

- As a general user, I want to create a custom recipe and list its required ingredients so that the app can recommend it when my pantry matches.

- As a general user, I want to add personal notes or tweaks to a saved recipe so that I can remember improvements.
