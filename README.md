# TasteBase
> *The go-to place to pick out your meals. Just pick an ingredient (or more) and let us find you recipes!*

Aaron Espinoza, Heston Montagne, Dylan Priebe, Jeremiah Stone, and Russel Sulivan are working together to create a web-app that connects users who want to improve their cooking skills to recipes that are relevant to their tastes and available ingredients. The goal of the app is to make cooking feel easier for aspiring cooks who find the process daunting by simplifying the research step.

## General Information
TasteBase is the solution to figuring out what you want to cook. We intend to make recipe selection the easiest process in the world, based on the ingredients you have at home already.
We hope to help everyone who cooks pick out their food more easily and deliberately. 


## Technologies Used
- React Native
- Java
- SQL
- The Meal DB


## Features
List the ready features here:
- Intuitive recipe searching

### Pantry Tracking: 
This feature allows users to add and remove ingredients from their personal pantry so they can easily track their available ingredients. 

***Corresponding Stories***

- As a general user, I want to view a list of my ingredients so that I can easily track my available ingredients for cooking. 

- As a general user, I want to add ingredients to my pantry so that I can keep my pantry up to date when I buy new food items. 

- As a general user, I want to delete ingredients from my pantry so that I can keep my pantry up to date as I use or get rid of food items.

### Recipe Suggestion
This feature allows the app to suggest recipes to the user for them to cook. It uses the user's pantry to filter recipes based on ingredients the user has on hand. 

***Corresponding Stories***

- As a general user, I want the app to recommend recipes for me to cook so I can try out new recipes when cooking.

- As a general user, I want the recipes recommended to me to be filtered to fit the ingredients I have in my pantry.
